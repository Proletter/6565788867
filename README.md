- Implementation is built using nodejs/express framework on the backend and a static html site on the frontned
- Both components are to be deployed in a kubernetes cluster
- Mongo DB is the database of choice and that should also be deployed on the same cluster
- This would allow for each of the component to be scaled out independently of the others.
